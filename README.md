## Overview
_This project is a part of the Udacity Senior Frontend Engineer - OLX Scholarship Nanodegree._ The aim of this project is to build an application that employees of any company can use internally to create polls with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, there is a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered.

## App Features
The app has the following features:
- Main home page with categorization of polls as ***answered*** or ***unanswered***
